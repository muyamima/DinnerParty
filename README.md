DinnerParty is intented as an aid for organising "DinnerParties".

1. DinnerParty:
  Sometimes also called:
  > „Run and Dine“ (also „Run&Dine“), „Flying Dinner“ or „Switching Tables“. In German sometimes "Rudirockt" or simplified to "Rudi".
  Translated from [de.wikipedia.org](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_Dinner)
  
  In the event teams of two people are jumbled up and assigned timeslots and courses to prepare for themselves and two guest teams.
  Usually one of either starter, main course or dessert.
  In addition each team is then also provided with two addresses and timeslots for the other courses to which they are invited.
  Optionally at the end a big party can then be organised to meet all participants once more.
